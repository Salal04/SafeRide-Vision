# SafeRide Vision

**SafeRide Vision** is a computer vision project for **motorcycle safety monitoring**.  
It automatically detects whether a rider is wearing a **helmet**, checks for **bike mirrors**, and identifies the **number plate** from traffic camera videos.

The system uses **deep learning-based object detection** (like YOLO and DeepSort) to detect these objects accurately.  
This helps improve **road safety**, **traffic rule enforcement**, and **smart traffic monitoring systems**.
